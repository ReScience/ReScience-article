Motivation for replication
===============================================================================

It has been said many times by many authors in the litterature that
reproducibility is the cornerstone of Science and we, as a scientific
community, should aim at such reproducibility. However, good intention are not
sufficient and a given computational results can be declared reproducible if
and only if it has been actually replicated in a the sense of a brand new
open-source and documented implementation. As explained before, writing such
replication might be a daunting taks that is not really rewarded and we may
thus wondered what could be the motivation for doing so ? Such motivations are
indeed diverse and range from the simple student who want to train oneself in
order to get familiar with a specific scientific domain up to the senior
researcher that has a critical need of a specific piece of code:

**@stachelek:2016**: I was motivated to replicate the results of the original
paper because I feel that working through code supplements to blog posts has
really helped me learn how to science. I could have published my replication as
a blog post but I wanted the exposure and permanency that goes along with
journal articles. This was my first experience with formal replication. I think
the review was useful because it forced me to consider how the replication
would be used by people other than myself. I have not yet experienced any new
interactions following publication. However, I did notify the author of the
original implementation about the replication's publication. I think this may
lead to future correspondence. The original author suggested that he would
consider submitting his own replications to ReScience in the future.

**@topalidou:2015:b**: Our initial motivation and the main reason for
replicating the model is that we needed it in order to collaborate with our
neurobiologist colleagues. When we arrived in our new lab, the model has
just been published (2013) but the original author left the lab a few
months before our arrival. And of course, there were no public repository,
no version control and the paper describing the model was incomplete and
partly inaccurate. In the end, we get our hands on the original sources
(6,000 lines of Delphi) only to realize we could not compile them. It took
us three months to replicate it using 250 lines of Python. But at this
time, there were no place to publish this kind of replication and share the
new code with colleagues. Since then, we have refined the model and made
new predictions that have been confirmed. Our initial replication effort
really gave the model a second life.

**@viejo:2016**: Replicating previous work is a relatively routine task
every time we want to build a new model: either because we want to build on
it, or because we want to compare to it. We also give replication tasks to
M.Sc. students every year, as projects. In all these cases, we are
confronted to incomplete or inaccurate model descriptions, as well as to
the impossibility to obtain the original results. Contacting the original
authors sometimes solves the problem, but not so often (because of the "dog
ate my hard drive" syndrom). We thus accumulate knowledge, internal to the
lab, about which model work, which doesn't, and how a given model has to be
parameterized to really work. Without any place to publish it, this
knowledge is wasted. Publishing it in ReScience, opening the discussion
publicly, will be a progress for all of us.

ReScience already published 4 articles and as shown above, the original
motivations of these authors are all different and this might become even more
obvious and diverse with future publications. But, beyond these motivations,
publishing in ReScience may be especially important for students since this
represent a unique opportunity to show the community a given student is able to
read a scientific article, to have a deep understanding of it, to write a new
implementation and to eventually write a scientific article describing his/her
work. Although the ReScience publishing model is a bit different from other
academic journals, it can give students a first experience at peer-reviewed
scholarly publishing, including meeting standards of scientific rigor and
addressing reviewers' comments. Furthermore, publishing in ReScience is a way
to actively contribute to open science while adding to one's publication
record.
